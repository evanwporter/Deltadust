# Deltadust

(Name is a placeholder for now, until we think of something better).

Deltadust is a game created in C# with Monogame. My sister and I have working on this for a bit. Its unlikely this will go anywhere until our schedules free up.

Note that this for testing purposes this game uses licesensed assets most noticably from Stardew Valley. If we ever have enough time to go somewhere with this game then this will change.
